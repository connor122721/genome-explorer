# Genome Explorer ðŸ§¬
A fun web app I built to explore sequenced genomes from NCBI. This was my first app-building project, and I wanted to create something quick and lightweight around genomics!

## What it does
Click a button and explore a random species with sequenced genomes. Each species shows:
- Scientific & common names
- Genome assembly statistics (size, N50, sequencing technology)
- A phylogenetic tree showing where the species fits in the Tree of Life (Phylum level)
- Interesting facts about the organism
- Direct links to NCBI's genome database

The first species is *Daphnia pulex* (the organism I did my PhD on)

## Features
- 30 curated species including model organisms, invasive species, and some weird/wonderful ones
- Assembly data verified against NCBI records
- Phylogeny visualization at the phylum level
- Responsive design with animations

## Live Demo

## Why I built this
I wanted to learn basic web development and thought a genome explorer would be a fun way to combine coding with my research interests. Plus, I've always wanted to highlight how many cool organisms have sequenced genomes now!

## Technologies
Just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - keeping it simple for my first project.

## Species included
Humans, fruit flies, water fleas, tardigrades, spotted lanternflies, barnacles, octopuses, and more!
